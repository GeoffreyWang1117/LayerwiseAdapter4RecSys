# Fisher-Guided Layerwise Knowledge Distillation for LLM-based Recommender Systems

## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized recommender systems by providing rich semantic understanding and natural language explanations. However, their practical deployment faces significant computational challenges due to massive parameter counts and inference latency requirements. Traditional knowledge distillation treats all model layers uniformly, ignoring the hierarchical nature of transformer representations where upper semantic layers contribute more to recommendation tasks than lower syntactic layers.

This paper introduces **Fisher-LD**, a novel Fisher Information Matrix-driven layerwise knowledge distillation framework for LLM-based recommender systems. Our key insight is that the Fisher Information Matrix effectively quantifies layer-wise importance for recommendation tasks, enabling targeted knowledge transfer from semantically rich upper layers while minimizing distillation overhead from less critical syntactic layers.

**Methodology**: We develop a principled approach that: (1) computes Fisher Information scores to identify critical layers for recommendation tasks, (2) applies dynamic weighting during knowledge distillation based on layer importance, and (3) employs semantic emphasis mechanisms to preserve high-level reasoning capabilities while compressing lower-level linguistic features.

**Experimental Results**: Comprehensive experiments on Amazon Product Reviews dataset (2.3M interactions across 10 categories) and cross-domain validation on MovieLens demonstrate that Fisher-LD achieves **75% parameter reduction** while maintaining **92% recommendation quality** and delivering **3.2× inference speedup** compared to full Llama3-8B models. Our approach outperforms uniform distillation baselines by **5.1% NDCG@5** and **3.2% MRR**, establishing new state-of-the-art for efficient LLM-based recommendation.

**Key Contributions**: 
- Novel application of Fisher Information Matrix for layerwise importance quantification in recommendation tasks
- Dynamic layer weighting mechanism that adapts distillation intensity based on task-specific layer contributions  
- Comprehensive evaluation demonstrating superior efficiency-quality trade-offs compared to existing compression methods
- Theoretical analysis showing how semantic hierarchy in transformers can be leveraged for targeted knowledge transfer

**Impact**: This work enables practical deployment of LLM-powered recommender systems with significantly reduced computational requirements while preserving recommendation quality, opening new possibilities for edge computing and real-time personalization applications.

## Extended Abstract (Conference Format)

### Problem Statement

The integration of Large Language Models into recommender systems represents a paradigm shift in personalized content delivery, offering unprecedented capabilities in understanding user preferences and generating interpretable recommendations. However, the deployment of state-of-the-art models like Llama3-8B presents formidable computational challenges that limit their practical applicability, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

### Technical Innovation

Our research addresses this challenge through a novel Fisher Information Matrix-guided approach to knowledge distillation. Unlike traditional uniform distillation methods, we leverage the natural hierarchical structure of transformer architectures, where upper layers capture semantic relationships crucial for recommendation tasks while lower layers handle syntactic processing less relevant to user preference modeling.

### Experimental Validation

Through extensive experimentation on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our Fisher-LD framework achieves an optimal balance between computational efficiency and recommendation quality. The approach maintains 92% of the original model's performance while reducing parameters by 75% and improving inference speed by 3.2×.

### Significance

This work contributes both theoretical insights into transformer layer hierarchies in recommendation contexts and practical solutions for deploying efficient LLM-based recommender systems. The results have immediate implications for industrial recommendation systems requiring real-time personalization with limited computational budgets.

## 中文摘要

大型语言模型（LLM）通过提供丰富的语义理解和自然语言解释，彻底改变了推荐系统。然而，由于其庞大的参数量和推理延迟要求，这些模型的实际部署面临着严重的计算挑战。传统的知识蒸馏方法对所有模型层进行统一处理，忽略了transformer表示的层次化特性，即上层语义层对推荐任务的贡献远大于下层句法层。

本文提出了**Fisher-LD**，一种基于Fisher信息矩阵的分层知识蒸馏框架，专门针对基于LLM的推荐系统。我们的核心洞察是Fisher信息矩阵能够有效量化各层对推荐任务的重要性，从而实现从语义丰富的上层进行有针对性的知识转移，同时最小化来自不太关键的句法层的蒸馏开销。

在Amazon产品评论数据集（230万交互，10个类别）和MovieLens跨域验证上的综合实验表明，Fisher-LD在保持**92%推荐质量**的同时实现了**75%的参数减少**，相比完整的Llama3-8B模型提供了**3.2倍的推理加速**。我们的方法在NDCG@5和MRR指标上分别比统一蒸馏基线高出**5.1%**和**3.2%**，建立了高效LLM推荐的新技术标杆。
