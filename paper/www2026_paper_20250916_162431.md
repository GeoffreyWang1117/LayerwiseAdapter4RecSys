**Conference**: WWW 2026  
**Date**: September 2025

## Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in recommendation systems, but their computational demands limit practical deployment. This paper presents an adaptive layer truncation approach for efficient knowledge distillation in recommendation tasks, specifically targeting the compression of LLaMA-based recommendation models.

**Key Contributions**:
1. **Adaptive Layer Selection**: A dynamic approach that selects 75% of the most important layers
2. **Multi-Method Analysis**: Four complementary importance quantification methods
3. **Compact Student Architecture**: 34.8M parameters, achieving 25.0% compression ratio
4. **End-to-End Distillation**: Complete teacher→student knowledge transfer pipeline

**Results**: Our approach achieves 43.8% accuracy with validation loss of 0.3257, demonstrating effective knowledge preservation while significantly reducing model size.
