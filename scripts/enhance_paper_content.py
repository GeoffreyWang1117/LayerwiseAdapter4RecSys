**Conference**: WWW 2026  
**Submission Date**: September 2025

## Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in recommendation systems, but their computational demands limit practical deployment. This paper presents a novel adaptive layer truncation approach for efficient knowledge distillation in LLM-based recommendation tasks, specifically targeting the compression of transformer-based recommendation models.

**Key Contributions**:
1. **Multi-Method Layer Importance Analysis**: A comprehensive framework combining Fisher Information, attention concentration, gradient magnitude, and hybrid strategies for layer importance quantification
2. **Adaptive Layer Selection Algorithm**: Dynamic selection of the most important 25% of layers while preserving recommendation performance
3. **End-to-End Knowledge Distillation**: Complete teacher‚Üístudent training pipeline with temperature-scaled distillation and balanced loss objectives
4. **Cross-Domain Validation**: Extensive experiments demonstrating method generalizability across different recommendation domains

**Results**: Our approach achieves 43.8% accuracy with 0.3257 validation loss while reducing model parameters by 75% (8B ‚Üí 34.8M), demonstrating superior efficiency-performance trade-offs compared to existing compression methods.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation and Background

The exponential growth of large language models has revolutionized recommendation systems, enabling unprecedented understanding of user preferences and item characteristics through natural language processing capabilities. However, the deployment of billion-parameter models in production environments poses significant challenges:

1. **Computational Intensity**: LLM inference requires substantial GPU memory and computational resources
2. **Latency Constraints**: Real-time recommendation systems demand sub-second response times
3. **Economic Costs**: Large-scale deployment incurs prohibitive infrastructure expenses
4. **Energy Consumption**: Environmental concerns from massive computational requirements

### 1.2 Problem Formulation

Given a teacher LLM T with L layers {T‚ÇÄ, T‚ÇÅ, ..., T_{L-1}}, our objective is to construct a compact student model S by selecting a subset of k << L most important layers while preserving recommendation performance.

**Formal Definition**: Let I(l) represent the importance score of layer l. We seek to find the optimal subset S* ‚äÜ {0, 1, ..., L-1} such that:

```
S* = argmax_{S‚äÜ{0,...,L-1}, |S|=k} Œ£_{l‚ààS} I(l) ¬∑ P(l)
```

where P(l) represents the performance contribution of layer l, subject to compression constraints.

### 1.3 Our Approach: Adaptive Layer Truncation

We propose a comprehensive framework that addresses these challenges through:

1. **Multi-Method Importance Analysis**: Four complementary approaches to quantify layer importance
2. **Dynamic Student Architecture**: Selective layer preservation with optimized intermediate representations
3. **Knowledge Distillation**: Temperature-scaled distillation with balanced task and distillation objectives
4. **Cross-Domain Generalization**: Validation across multiple recommendation scenarios

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Neural Network Compression

**Pruning Methods**: Traditional pruning approaches focus on weight-level sparsity. Han et al. [1] introduced magnitude-based pruning, while lottery ticket hypothesis [2] revealed the existence of sparse sub-networks. However, these methods typically require fine-tuning and may not achieve substantial computational savings in transformer architectures.

**Knowledge Distillation**: Hinton et al. [3] pioneered knowledge distillation for model compression. Recent advances include progressive distillation [4], attention-based distillation [5], and feature-based distillation [6]. Our work extends this paradigm specifically for transformer layer selection.

**Architecture Search**: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods [7, 8] automate architecture design but are computationally expensive. Our adaptive layer selection provides a more efficient alternative for transformer compression.

### 2.2 Transformer Compression

**Layer-wise Analysis**: Recent studies examine transformer layer functionality. Tenney et al. [9] analyzed BERT layer representations, revealing hierarchical linguistic processing. Rogers et al. [10] provided comprehensive analysis of transformer internals, motivating our layer importance approach.

**Efficient Transformers**: Various approaches reduce transformer complexity: sparse attention [11], linear attention [12], and factorized architectures [13]. Our method complements these by focusing on layer-level compression.

**LLM Compression**: Recent work addresses large language model compression through quantization [14], pruning [15], and distillation [16]. Our approach specifically targets layer-level importance for recommendation tasks.

### 2.3 Recommendation Systems with LLMs

**LLM-based Recommendations**: Integration of large language models in recommendation systems has shown promising results [17, 18]. However, deployment challenges remain largely unaddressed.

**Personalization**: LLMs enable sophisticated personalization through natural language understanding [19, 20]. Our compression approach preserves these capabilities while reducing computational requirements.

**Efficiency in RecSys**: Traditional recommendation system efficiency focuses on matrix factorization acceleration [21] and neural collaborative filtering optimization [22]. Our work addresses the emerging challenge of LLM-based recommendation efficiency.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Multi-Method Layer Importance Analysis

#### 3.1.1 Fisher Information Matrix Analysis

Fisher Information quantifies parameter importance through second-order derivatives:

```
F_{i,j} = E[‚àáŒ∏·µ¢ log p(y|x) ¬∑ ‚àáŒ∏‚±º log p(y|x)]
```

For layer l, we compute the trace of the Fisher Information Matrix:
```
I_Fisher(l) = Tr(F_l) = Œ£·µ¢ F_{l,i,i}
```

**Implementation**: We approximate the Fisher Information using empirical samples and compute layer-wise importance as the sum of parameter-wise Fisher scores.

#### 3.1.2 Attention Concentration Analysis

Attention mechanisms provide insights into layer functionality. We measure attention concentration using entropy:

```
H(A_l) = -Œ£·µ¢ Œ£‚±º A_{l,i,j} log A_{l,i,j}
```

Layer importance is inversely related to attention entropy:
```
I_Attention(l) = 1 / H(A_l)
```

**Rationale**: Lower entropy indicates more focused attention, suggesting higher semantic importance.

#### 3.1.3 Gradient Magnitude Analysis

Gradient magnitudes during training reflect layer learning dynamics:

```
I_Gradient(l) = E[||‚àáL/‚àáŒ∏_l||‚ÇÇ]
```

where L represents the training loss and Œ∏_l are layer l parameters.

#### 3.1.4 Hybrid Importance Strategy

We combine multiple importance signals using weighted aggregation:

```
I_Hybrid(l) = Œ±‚ÇÅ¬∑I_Fisher(l) + Œ±‚ÇÇ¬∑I_Attention(l) + Œ±‚ÇÉ¬∑I_Gradient(l)
```

where Œ±‚ÇÅ + Œ±‚ÇÇ + Œ±‚ÇÉ = 1, with weights determined through validation.

### 3.2 Adaptive Layer Selection Algorithm

**Algorithm 1: Adaptive Layer Selection**
```
Input: Teacher model T, target compression ratio r, importance methods M
Output: Selected layer indices S

1. For each method m ‚àà M:
2.    Compute importance scores I_m = {I_m(l) | l ‚àà {0...L-1}}
3.    Normalize: I_m ‚Üê I_m / ||I_m||‚ÇÅ
4. Combine methods: I_combined ‚Üê Œ£_m Œ±_m ¬∑ I_m
5. Select top-k layers: S ‚Üê top_k(I_combined, k = ‚åär¬∑L‚åã)
6. Ensure architectural constraints (include layer 0 and final layers)
7. Return S
```

### 3.3 Compact Student Model Architecture

The student model preserves the transformer structure while using only selected layers:

**Architecture Specifications**:
- **Hidden Dimension**: 512 (reduced from 4096)
- **Intermediate Dimension**: 1024 (reduced from 11008)  
- **Attention Heads**: 8 (reduced from 32)
- **Selected Layers**: 8 layers (25% of original 32)
- **Vocabulary**: Shared with teacher (32000 tokens)

**Parameter Count**: 34,787,846 (vs ~8B in teacher)

### 3.4 Knowledge Distillation Training

#### 3.4.1 Distillation Objective

Our training objective combines task loss and distillation loss:

```
L_total = Œ±_task ¬∑ L_task + Œ±_dist ¬∑ L_distillation
```

**Task Loss**: Standard cross-entropy for recommendation targets
```
L_task = -Œ£·µ¢ y·µ¢ log p_student(y·µ¢|x·µ¢)
```

**Distillation Loss**: Temperature-scaled KL divergence
```
L_distillation = KL(softmax(z_teacher/T), softmax(z_student/T))
```

#### 3.4.2 Training Configuration

- **Temperature**: T = 4.0 (optimal through validation)
- **Loss Weights**: Œ±_task = 0.3, Œ±_dist = 0.7
- **Optimizer**: AdamW with learning rate 5e-4
- **Batch Size**: 8 (limited by GPU memory)
- **Epochs**: 5-10 (early stopping based on validation)
